MORRIS an d MICHAEL MORRIS, LC No. 01-041095-NI \nDefendants-Appellees. \nBefore: Markey, P.J., and Murphy and Talbot, JJ. \nPER CURIAM. \nPlaintiff appeals as of right a judgme nt granting defendants\u2019 motion for summary \ndisposition in this action involving a motor vehicl e accident in which plaintiff was injured.  The \ntrial court ruled that, under MCL 500.3135, plaintiff\u2019 s injuries did not constitute a serious \nimpairment of body function.  Particularly, the trial court found, as a matter of law, that the \nthreshold requirement of serious impairment  of body function was not met because the \nimpairment did not affect plaintiff\u2019s general ability  to lead her normal life.  Therefore, plaintiff \nwas not entitled to any recovery for noneconomic lo ss.  We conclude, as a matter of law, that \nplaintiff\u2019s objectively manifested impairment did indeed affect plaintiff\u2019s general ability to lead her normal life.  Accordingly, plaintiff establ ished a serious impairment of body function and \nthe trial court\u2019s judgment is reversed. \nOn July 23, 2001, plaintiff was driving her car  north on M-120 in Muskegon Township. \nAt the same time, defendant Jamie Morris was driving his motor vehicl e heading south on the \nsame stretch of road.  Morris crossed the centerline and entered plaintiff\u2019s lane of traffic, \ncolliding with plaintiff\u2019s car. A second collision occurred when a vehicle following directly \nbehind plaintiff\u2019s car rear-ended plaintiff as a result of the first collision.   \nDefendants did not dispute the extent of the injuries sustained by plaintiff in the accident \nas identified in medical records.  The medical re cords reveal that plaintiff suffered a fractured -\ndislocated elbow along with other various injuri es.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "acded312-1520-4f7a-be14-f1c90ced10ca": {"__data__": {"id_": "acded312-1520-4f7a-be14-f1c90ced10ca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "sarahcase.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ac46a2fd-826b-466f-9d43-a5408e4e4bd0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "sarahcase.pdf"}, "hash": "9e01bfdec63343d0c26c71f93cde947ec85ce4cb7c4fec6576b0896a28e2e6d8"}, "2": {"node_id": "6e1c7d9a-9a49-4173-9663-1817bef70a1a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "sarahcase.pdf"}, "hash": "8b9dbbdf0026c43f57cdd7a7afd67e94486d422896f8a6d19a94622d40d356c6"}}, "hash": "d03231f03a058086f7291cda16df6260b02ad2ac730d2b95425a389143414c0e", "text": "Specifically, the emergency room record \ncontains the following diagnosis by the treating room physician: \nMotor vehicle accident with right el bow fracture dislocation, chest wall \ncontusion, bilateral forearm contusion as well as a to tal of 2.0 centimeters of left \nlaceration [to finger] with repair. \n-1-", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8d4432c8-0c39-402d-98bc-b98338113924": {"__data__": {"id_": "8d4432c8-0c39-402d-98bc-b98338113924", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "sarahcase.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "02df2ddf-8cd1-4a75-91ba-16dff54b5fd8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "sarahcase.pdf"}, "hash": "677d268d72d88f09fea6600f136bc597352d20ba44c63c87e6c58890cb3181fd"}, "3": {"node_id": "14a97093-a72b-49cf-b66f-cbeab03f381c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "sarahcase.pdf"}, "hash": "37572937538bcb10e4ab5c7fae0a7e514f2eb69b8daff35e5b16b561900bb545"}}, "hash": "7b40d9b4c264e44606e01da1a477b4045088dd3b899e7fe3ffc2dd6050d53413", "text": "A consulting doctor, who examined plaintiff la ter in the day on the date of the accident, \nopined: \nOn physical examination, her elbow is obviously dislocated, swollen, \ntender, deformed.  . . .

Although plaintiff had a good recovery, \u201can in jury need not be permanent to be \nserious.\u201d  In light of the seriousness of the initial injury, the treatment required, and the duration of disability, we hol d that plaintiff sustained a serious \nimpairment of body function.  [Citation omitted.] \nHere, plaintiff suffered a \u201cright elbow fr acture dislocation,\u201d re quiring surgery and the \nplacement of her arm in a sling, and precluding us e of the arm, which is an important body \nfunction. This was a serious injury, especially wh ere plaintiff already had limited use of her left \nhand. And although plaintiff has made a fairly good recovery, her injury need not be permanent. \nWe recognize that the timefram e in which the plaintiff in Kern was disabled is slightly longer \nthan the period in the case at bar; however, we find it long enough to support a finding that plaintiff sustained a serious  impairment of body function.\n3  Accordingly, the trial court erred in \nfinding that plaintiff had not suffered an impairment that affect ed her general ability to lead her \nnormal life.  Moreover, we find that as a matter of  law plaintiff suffered a serious impairment of \nbody function in light of the undisput ed facts.  Therefore, plain tiff has met the legal threshold \nnecessary to make a claim for noneconomic damages. \n3 In Straub v Collette (On Remand), 258 Mich App 456, 462-463; 670 NW2d 725 (2003), lv gtd \n469 Mich 948 (2003), this Court found a serious impairment of body function where the plaintiff \nlost the use of his left hand for three months, wh ich significantly affected the plaintiff\u2019s general \nability to lead his normal life given the work a nd tasks that he performed before the accident. \nHere, it was plaintiff\u2019s right arm that was inca pacitated for only a month or so less than the \nperiod in Straub. \n-4-", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "850d7205-1d87-4a9a-9d84-fe5dfb8a084a": {"__data__": {"id_": "850d7205-1d87-4a9a-9d84-fe5dfb8a084a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "sarahcase.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a81d2372-1baf-4076-8627-4e9020496779", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "sarahcase.pdf"}, "hash": "b5e52b5034a5382a2a6a555af1f175ad987245a76797fad69fa12b8315794cc8"}}, "hash": "9f3f2b14f632d4c2e366931691b067a7913714e1d3eb3e27c3285f9615cb8c90", "text": "Reversed and remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
