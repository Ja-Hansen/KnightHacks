# KnightHacks
This is the repository for Jacob Hansen, Isaac Powell, and Luke Lacsamana's KnightHacks hackathon project.

This project aims to create a user-interface between clients and Morgan and Morgan. It allows for users to upload documents to the website, view them, summarize documents, and even fully interact with the documents by asking specific questions on the information. This simplifies the burden of the client to fully read and understand specific legal documents.

For this project, the user will have to add their API keys to a .env folder.
The user will have to drop pdfs into the user_documents folder to be analyzed
