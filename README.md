# KnightHacks
This is the repository for Jacob Hansen, Isaac Powell, and Luke Lacsamana's KnightHacks hackathon project.

This project creates a user-interface between clients and Morgan and Morgan. It allows for users to upload documents to the website, view documents, have generative AI summarize the documents, and have generative AI interact with the documents by answering specific questions regarding information in the document. This simplifies the burden of the client to fully read and understand specific legal documents.

For this project, the user will have to add their API keys to a local .env folder.
The user will have to drop pdfs into the user_documents folder to be analyzed by the specific question feature.
